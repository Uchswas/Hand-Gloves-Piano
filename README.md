# Arduino based HandGloves Piano

The aim of this project is to make an Arduino-based piano that can be operated by
wearing hand gloves.In a typical harmonium, we create different types of tones or
music or lyrics. In our project, we used the  tone frequencies to make the same (sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni, sa) tone
that this can be used to create some music or musical tones. It’s like a small digital
Harmonium!  When one finger touches the thumb
finger corresponding tone will be sounded.
