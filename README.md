##  Arduino based HandGloves Piano

The aim of this project is to make an Arduino-based piano that can be operated by wearing hand gloves.In a typical harmonium, we create different types of tones or
music. In our project, we used the sound frequencies to make the same (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa) tone.It’s like a small digital Harmonium!  When one finger touches the thumb,A finger-corresponding tone will be sounded.
